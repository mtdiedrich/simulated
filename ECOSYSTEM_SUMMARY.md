# Ecosystem Simulation Summary

## Overview
This ecosystem simulation implements a robust and in-depth multi-species environment that addresses all the requirements specified:

## Features Implemented

### 1. Multiple Species
- **Plants** (Grass, Trees): Primary producers
- **Herbivores** (Rabbits, Deer): Primary consumers  
- **Carnivores** (Wolves, Hawks): Secondary consumers
- **Omnivores** (Bears): Tertiary consumers

### 2. Predator-Prey Relationships
- Complex food webs with realistic hunting mechanics
- Energy transfer through trophic levels
- Vision-based prey detection and hunting
- Realistic consumption and energy gain

### 3. Environmental Niches
- **Grassland**: High plant growth, moderate water
- **Forest**: Highest plant growth, good water
- **Water**: Low plant growth, maximum water
- **Rocky**: Minimal plant growth, low water

### 4. Population Dynamics
- Birth, death, aging, and reproduction cycles
- Energy-based survival systems
- Carrying capacity constraints
- Natural population regulation

### 5. Spatial Interactions
- 2D environment with movement and positioning
- Territory and resource competition
- Realistic movement patterns and behaviors
- Distance-based interactions

### 6. Resource Management
- Energy consumption and gain systems
- Environmental resource distribution
- Plant regeneration mechanisms
- Carrying capacity limits

## Ecological Realism

The simulation demonstrates several realistic ecological phenomena:

1. **Trophic Cascades**: Loss of predators leads to herbivore population growth
2. **Resource Competition**: Limited resources constrain population growth
3. **Population Cycles**: Predator-prey oscillations (though simplified)
4. **Niche Specialization**: Species perform better in preferred habitats
5. **Energy Flow**: Energy flows from producers through consumers

## Usage

### Basic Demo
```bash
python demo_ecosystem.py
```

### Training Analysis  
```bash
python train_ecosystem.py train
```

### Testing
```bash
python test_ecosystem.py
```

### Extended Simulation
```bash
python train_ecosystem.py
```

## Architecture

The simulation uses a modular, object-oriented design:

- **EcosystemEnvironment**: Manages spatial structure and resources
- **Organism**: Base class for all living entities
- **Population**: Manages groups of organisms
- **EcosystemSimulation**: Orchestrates the entire simulation

## Extensibility

The codebase is designed for easy extension:

- Add new species types by extending the Organism class
- Modify environmental niches and resources
- Adjust population dynamics parameters
- Implement new behaviors and interactions
- Add visualization and analysis tools

## Educational Value

This simulation demonstrates key ecological concepts:

- Food webs and energy flow
- Population dynamics and regulation
- Species interactions and competition
- Environmental influences on populations  
- Ecosystem stability and resilience

The simulation provides a solid foundation for understanding complex ecological systems and can be used for research, education, and experimentation with different ecological scenarios.
